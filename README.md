# Physics-Engine
Simple Physics Engine using the SFML graphics library\
a pet project of mine - created to assist my learning of the c++ language, git, and gcc

the included batch file will create an executible in the bin directory if g++ is installed on your system\
if you are not using windows, the g++ compilation command is as follows:\
g++ src/main.cpp src/game.cpp src/entity.cpp -Isrc/include -Iinclude -Llib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o bin/ball
